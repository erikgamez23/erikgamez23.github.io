		 										Ever since I first laid my hands on the GameBoy Advance SP, I have loved games, phones, and most of all, computers. In my sophomore year of high school, I finally saved up enough money after working for a few months to construct my first computer after buying parts online. When I was finished, I had started what would continue to be my passion to this day.
												Now, I'm studying to complete a Bachelor's in Computer Science specializing in Systems at Indiana University-Bloomington.

												I love traveling! I've been to many cities in Mexico and visited 17 out of the 50 states.

												I absolutely adore being with my closest friends! I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have the friend group I have today. They are the foundation to my happiness and I don't see them ever leaving my life.

												Unsurprisingly, I also love indulging in different foods. There are so many different tastes and exploring them is a hobby.

								In this essay, I explained how the competition between AMD and Intel is forcing Intel to improve products by researching and developing better technologies,
								which in turn is creating better performance for the end consumers. Click on the link below to download it.

							<center><h4>Missouri Trip</h4></center>

							<center>Just recently, I took a trip to Missouri to study the development of igneous Rocks and the erosion of Pre-Camian (Very Old) sedimentary rock.
								I learned that Missouri used to be covered in seas due to global rises in water level. This left sand to be made into sandstone and uncovered ancient
								igneous rocks that are now present and visible today. I took many pictures and they're all in a Google Photos album. Click on the link below to find them.
